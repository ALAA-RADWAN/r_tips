# Introduction    

This tutorial extends our exploration of discrete probability distributions, which began with [an introduction to bernoulli trials and the binomial distribution](https://github.com/erikaduan/R-tips/blob/master/03_blog_posts/2020-09-12_binomial_distribution/2020-09-12_binomial-distribution.md#drawing-control-limits-for-binomial-proportions-funnel-plots).     

As revision, we may recall that the binomial distribution has the following properties:  

+ It allows us to calculate the probability of $k$ number of successes occurring out of $n$ bernoulli trials, where the outcome of each trial is independent of each other and has the same probability of occuring.    
+ Its probability mass function is calculated from a) the total number of all possible combinations of $k$ trial successes and b) the probability of one single arrangement of $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures.    
$$P(X=x) = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} \times p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}$$    
+ Its mean is $E(X) = n\times p$ and its variance is $Var(X) = n \times p(1-p)$.

# Hypergeometric distribution     

The hypergeometric distribution is used in scenarios where sampling without replacement occurs (i.e. the outcome obtained is dependent on the prior samples that were selected). We cannot use the binomial distribution here as the outcome of each trial is not independent of each other.    

Instead, we use the combinations formula to aid us in calculating the hypergeometric distribution.     

To extend the combinations formula, we consider the following five parameters:    

+ $P(X = x)$ is the probability of obtaining $x$ successes from a sample of $n$.    
+ $N$ is the size of the population.    
+ $n$ is the size of the sample.  
+ $k$ is the number of successes in the population $N$.  
+ $x$ is the number of successes in the sample $n$.     

**Note:** Once a sample (i.e. event success) is taken out of the population without replacement, the probability of observing an event success changes. This is most impacted when $N$ is a small number.       

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.show = 'hold', out.width = '80%'}     
knitr::include_graphics("../../02_figures/2020-09-22_hypergeometric-distribution.jpg")    
```

The mean of the hypergeometric distribution can be derived as $E(X) = n\times \frac{k}{N}$.       
The variance of the hypergeometric distribution is defined as $Var(X) = n\times \frac{k}{N}\times \frac{N-n}{N}\times \frac{N-k}{N-1}$.

# Approximating the hypergeometric distribution with the binomial distribution  

The binomial distribution can sometimes be used to approximate the hypergeometric distribution. This occurs when we are sampling no more than 5% of a large population (so the probability of a successful event occuring does not significantly change as we sample without replacement).      

We can explore this further using a simulation using the scenario above, but where:  

1. The sample size is 5% of the population (n = 30 and N = 600). 
2. The sample size is 10% of the population (n = 30 and N = 300).  
3. The sample size is 25% of the population (n = 30 and N = 120).

# Geometric distribution    

The [geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution) describes the probability mass function of the number of bernoulli trials required before we encounter the first successful trial outcome. It is useful for modelling events of high importance (i.e. the probability of a random citizen being able to provide CPR).   

The probability mass function of a geometric distribution can be described as the probability of encountering $x-1$ trial failures before encountering the first trial success (i.e. we define $X$ as the number of trials required to obtain the first successful event).     
$$P(X=x) = (1-p)^{x-1}\times p \; for \; x = 1, 2, ..., x$$  

The mean of the geometric distribution can be derived as $E(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{1} x \times p(x) = \frac{1}{p}$.     

The variance of the geometric distribution is defined as $Var(X) = \frac{1-p}{p^2}$.    

**Note:** The function `dgeom(x, prob)` defines $x$ as the number of trial failures that occur before the first success is observed.    

```{r, results = 'hide'}
#-----calculate probability of geometric distribution-----    
# example 1  
# what is the probability that the 6th person in a population knows CPR i.e. P(x = 6)       

p <- 0.3 # success = person who knows CPR (0.3)
x <- 6 # number of trials taken to encounter person who knows CPR  

dgeom(x - 1, p) 
#> [1] 0.050421  

# example 2  
# what is the probability the 1st to 4th person is the 1st person who knows CPR i.e. P(x <= 4)  

dgeom(c(seq(0, 3, 1)), p) %>%
  sum(.)
#> [1] 0.7599   

1 - ((1 - p)^4)  
#> [1] 0.7599   
```

**Note:** The probability of a success first occuring before or during the $x^{th}$ trial is the complement of the probability of a success first occuring after more than $x$ trials. The latter event is also defined as the probability of $x^{th}$ failures occuring. The cummulative probability distribution for the geometric distribution is thus defined below.        
$$P(X\leq x) = 1 - P(X > x) = 1 - (1-p)^{x}$$       

```{r, out.width = '60%'}
#-----calculate probability mass function of geometric distribution-----
# what is the probability mass function of obtaining the first 1 (success) from a fair dice  
# assuming a maximum of 15 throws 
# calculate P(x = X) where X represents the number of trials needed to observe the first success  

p <- 1/6
x <- seq(0, 14, 1) 

geom_dist <- set_names(x, seq(1, 15, 1)) %>%
  map_df(~ dgeom(.x, 1/6)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = "X",
               values_to = "prob") 

mean_geom <- 1 / (1/6)  

#-----visualise probability mass function of geometric distribution-----  
geom_dist %>%
  mutate(X = as.numeric(X)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = X, y = prob)) +  
  geom_segment(aes(x = X, xend = X, y = 0, yend = prob)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 21, fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_geom, linetype = "dashed", colour = "cornflowerblue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(seq(0, 15, 1))) + 
  labs(y = "Probability",
       title = "Geometric distribution of number of fair dice throws required to land on 1") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, colour = "black"),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))   
```

**Note:** The minimum value of the geometric distribution is 1 (i.e. the first trial obtains a successful outcome) and there is no upper bound. The mode of the geometric distribution is always 1, with probabilities decreasing with larger values of $x$ (i.e. right skewness).      


# Negative binomial distribution  

Extending the concept of the geometric distribution, the negative binomial distribution describes the probability mass function of the number of benoulli trials required to obtain the $r^{th}$ success (i.e. for a single distribution, the variable $r$ is fixed amd P(X) represents the number of bernoulli trials required to obtain the $r^{th}$ success.    

This means that the negative binomial distribution must obtain the following conditions:  

+ The $x-1$ trial must contain $r-1$ successes i.e. $\frac{(x-1)!}{(r-1)!((x-1)-(r-1))!} \times p^{(r-1)}(1-p)^{(x-1)-(r-1)}$  
+ The $x^{th}$ trial must also be a success and has a probability of $p$.  
+ To calculate the probability mass function of the $x^{the}$ trial, we simply multiple the two equations above (as events occur independently of each other).   

The probability mass function can be written below, as the probability that the $x^{th}$ bernoulli trial contains the $r{^th}$ success.  
$$P(X=x) = \frac{(x-1)!}{(r-1)!((x-1)-(r-1))!} \times p^{(r-1)}(1-p)^{(x-1)-(r-1)} \times p$$
$$P(X=x) = \frac{(x-1)!}{(r-1)!(x-r)!} \times p^{r}(1-p)^{(x-r)}\;for\;x=r, r+1,...$$  

The mean is $E(X) = \frac{r}{p}$.  
The variance is $Var(X) = \frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}$.    

**NOte:** The function `dnbinom(x, size, prob)` defines $x$ as the number of failures prior to the $r^{th}$ success.
